This repository accompanies the paper:

[WF Podlaski & CK Machens (2024). "Approximating nonlinear functions with latent boundaries in low-rank excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks". 	Neural Computation 36.5: 803-857.](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/36/5/803/120324/Approximating-Nonlinear-Functions-With-Latent)

- The folder `figure_generation_code` contains a set of python scripts to generate each figure of the paper.
- The folder `net_sim_code` contains some python functions used to simulate the spiking networks in the figures.
