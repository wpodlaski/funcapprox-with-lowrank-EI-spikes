This repository accompanies the paper:

[WF Podlaski & CK Machens (2023). "Approximating nonlinear functions with latent boundaries in low-rank excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks". 	arXiv:2307.09334.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09334) (accepted and forthcoming in Neural Computation)

- The folder `figure_generation_code` contains a set of python scripts to generate each figure of the paper.
- The folder `net_sim_code` contains some python functions used to simulate the spiking networks in the figures.
